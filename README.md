## The Ultimate Productivity Tool for Professional Procrastinators

Welcome to Protaskinate, the task manager designed for people who love planning their work almost as much as they love avoiding it. 

Features That Definitely Won’t Enable Your Procrastination:

- 📆 Future You’s Problem Scheduler – Schedule tasks for arbitrary dates. Future You will totally handle it.
- 🎨 Customization Station – Spend hours picking the perfect color scheme instead of actually working.
- 🏆 Dopamine Dashboard – Check your stats for that sweet, sweet sense of productivity (whether or not you did anything).
- 🪦 KanBan Board – a.k.a. the Task Cemetery - Where to-do items go to be ignored forever.
- 🔎 Sort & Filter Like a Pro – Filter by due date, priority, or vibes.
- 🔕 (Not So) Urgent Notifications – You'll get a subtle, possibly annoying, hint when something slips past it's due date.
- 🌚 Dark Mode – Because everything looks less urgent in dark mode.
- ☠️ That's all. What did you expect - a celebration for every task completed?
